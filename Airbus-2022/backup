Dear Sir or Madam,

\smallskip

to thrive as a researcher in mathematics and computer science, I herewith apply for the internship on Formal Verification for Cybersecurity.
I am capable of conducting the relevant research in this area and am excited to develop new reasoning techniques for reactive systems and logics for programming languages.
Both my quick comprehension of complex topics as well as my passion for mathematical methods in computer science make me the most suitable candidate for the internship at Airbus Cyber Security.

My desire to focus on theoretical computer science and logic was sparked in May 2018, when I attended the summer school of the Hausdorff trimester program ``Types Sets and Constructions''.
Studying at Stockholm university provided me with the perfect environment to focus more specifically on the constructive aspects of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science.
I completed courses in Type Theory, Modal and Temporal Logic, Theory for Computation and Formal Language. 
Additionally, I attended the PhD-courses ``Proof Theory and Subsystems of Second Order Arithmetic" and ``Infinity-categories" during my masters studies.

I completed my master thesis together with my supervisors Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine and Guillaume Brunerie on the 30st of March 2020 with the title ``An analysis of Curiens explicit syntax for Dependent Type Theory".
My thesis proves a strong equivalence theorem, which functions as a tool to construct \emph{weak models} for dependent type theories.
The definitions and proofs are formalized in the proof assistant Agda\footnote{https://github.com/philippstassen/initiality/tree/develop1}.

Since 2020 I am enrolled as a PhD at the Center for Basic Research in Program Verification at the Aarhus University.
Together with my supervisor Lars Birkedal and other collaborators I investigate propabalistic programs and modal type systems.
Modal type theories are strong enough to capture complicated structures such as streams and reactive programs.

For your future projects I can benefit you through my deep insight in theoretical computer science and my vast experience in the field of type systems.

%Mein Ziel ist es, die praktischen Realitäten mehr in meine Forschung einzubringen, und umgekehrt zu sehen, wo mein theoretisches Wissen Anwendung findet – deshalb möchte ich mehr darüber lernen wie Software Architektur von Critical Systems in der Praxis umgesetzt wird.

I am determined to acquire techniques and skills that are practically relevant and reflect those into my ongoing research. Conversely, I want to see how my theoretical knowledge is applied and explore alternative career paths.

With my experience in and excitement for computer science,
your internship provides me with the perfect opportunity to work interdisciplinary and to create practical applications for Program Verification.


Sincerely yours,

\smallskip
Philipp Stassen
